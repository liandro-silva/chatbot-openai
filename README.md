## How to Run Locally

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using your preferred package manager. For example, if you're using npm:

    ```
    cd repository-name
    npm install
    ```
    **OR**
    <br>
    ```
    cd repository-name
    yarn
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it as an environment variable. You can get the API key by signing up on the OpenAI website. Once you have the API key, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here
    ```

    Make sure to replace `your-api-key-goes-here` with your actual API key.

4. **Start the Development Server**: Once you have installed the dependencies and configured the environment variables, you can start the development server with the following command:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    **OR**
    <br>
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```

5. **Access the Application**: Once the server is running, you can access the application in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
